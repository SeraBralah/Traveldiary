# Travel Journal

This project was created as part of my second year of university studies in computer science. Built in **Java SDK 11** and **JavaFX**, it allows users to create a personal travel journal. You can record details of your trips, add photos, and save or load your journal at any time.
This project was completed in less than a month as a culmination of my second year studies.
